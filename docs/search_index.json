Duckles 2024-10-19 Chapter 1 XOXO Community Survey 2024 Welcome to the XOXO Community Survey 2024 report. This report covers various aspects of community engagement and feedback collected during the survey. 1.1 Table of Contents Introduction Values in the Community Appreciation for the Community Concerns in the Community "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What this is 2.2 Lower your expectations 2.3 Gift", " Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What this is This is a short, vibe check community survey of the XOXO community. In early October, Andy McMillan and Andy Baio (sometimes collectively referred to as “the Andys”) announced that because the festival had ended this year, they would be closing down the XOXO Slack community that has been going since the beginning of the festival. There was a lot of discussion in the slack and some folks suggested we might want to do a survey to discuss next directions. In consultation with Pete Modica-Soloway, Josh Millard and Nora Ryan, I (Beth Duckles) put together this survey to start the conversation. This report is meant to summarize the findings and to pull out key themes so as to start the conversation. 2.2 Lower your expectations I have done a quick organization of the comments for each question into themes as a way to share the information that came from the survey. In each theme, I add a bunch of quotes that describe what I’m seeing. The qualitative coding/tagging (meaning grouping responses into themes) is rough, imperfect and it was done very quickly. I wanted the community have something fast more than I wanted to perfect it. That means there might be a theme you see that I didn’t create, or something that fits with multiple themes. You might disagree with how I named the groupings, or you might think a quote in a theme is wrong altogether. All of this is great. If you think something is was placed in the wrong spot, or that I missed a theme or that it’s named wrong, you are probably right. You’re invited to let us know, point out mistakes or to do another pass at it on your own or read the raw data in the dataset if you’d prefer that. The goal for this for paper was to create an easier way to start a community discussion, not a final “in stone” explanation of what everyone was saying. By reflecting what I saw/read in the data, I’m starting the process of summarizing to get our conversation going. Please, don’t worry about my feelings and go ahead and converse. It’s also LONG, so I understand that it might feel overwhelming. I made it long because I feel strongly that listening to the many voices of other people involves letting their words be at the center. So I include a lot (a lot) of quotes. This may be overwhelming. I am sorry about that. I’ve done my best to summarize so you don’t have to read it all unless you want to. I encourage you to skip sections if you don’t want to read something, or just go straight to the comments for the Andy’s and commence weeping. Or not. You do you. There are likely a lot of typos. If you feel strongly about this and want to contribute, you are warmly invited to copy edit what I’ve written. However, in this kind of research, I don’t edit what people write in their response to the survey. This means that if there are typos in what people wrote, there are typos in how it is shown here. This is not meant to shame anyone, but rather to preserve what people say and how they say it. I don’t presume I know better how to say what someone else is saying than they do. 2.3 Gift This work is a gift freely given to a community that has given me so so much. It is also something I’ve been able to do because I am between projects and I have free time right now as a freelance researcher. Which means, I am looking for work. This is a small section of the kind of things I can do research-wise. Just think of how much more I could do if I was paid! If you want to talk to me about research projects for money or want to drop a few bucks my way, I’m always up for it: beth@duckles.com. "],["community-values.html", "Chapter 3 Community Values 3.1 Community Value Theme Groupings", " Chapter 3 Community Values The question we asked was: “If you were to briefly summarize the core values of the XOXO Slack Community as it exists now, what would they be? Many folks responded with a string of words separated by commas, so I pulled those apart, counted them and collapsed where appropriate (e.g. creative, creativity and creations became creativity). Others wrote a phrase or a sentence and those are interspersed in the discussion where they added to the themes. The most popular words folks used were: (approximate number in parentheses): * Empathy (27) * Kindness (26) * Creative (25) * Openness (14) * Community (15) * Curiosity (13) * Inclusivity (12) * Thoughtful (11) * Support (9) * Compassionate (9) * Fun (7) * Caring (6) * Respect (6) * Enthusiastic (5) * Helpful (5) * Generosity (4) * Friendly (3) * Sharing (3) 3.1 Community Value Theme Groupings I grouped the words together in themes that I came up with based on what folks wrote/said. I added quotes to match the groupings. All groupings are open to discussion/interpretation and clearly there is a lot of overlap. 3.1.1 1) Community Quite a few people used words related to community such as: support, sharing, acceptance, generosity, mutual support, supportive, camaraderie, mutual aid, togetherness, care for each other, cooperation, equity, giving voice to the marginalized, giving others the benefit of the doubt, lifting each other up, mutual respect, togetherness, authenticity, tolerance, trust, utopianism and validation. Quotes on community: * thoughtful community based on lifting up and informing each other * Inclusive community * Unique set of people with a lot of things in common that supports each other and shares good stuff 3.1.2 2) Creative/Weird/Fun Creative was the most used word, and it seemed to also encompass the idea of artistry and a sense of fun. Folks used words like: enthusiastic, humor, entertaining, exciting, making weird stuff for fun, playful, sharing fun things, sharing neat projects and weirdness. Some quotes around this theme: * Give creative, smart, good-hearted people a safe way to express themselves, connect with others, learn to share themselves with the world, and live fulfilling sustainable creative lives. * A welcoming community for the best weirdos the internet has to offer * A community of people who build good internet-related things (loosely defined).

They also used words like: respect, friendly, helpful, encouragement, inviting, welcoming, inclusiveness. While the words inclusivity and openness were used, some also described the community being closed as part of this inclusivity. Some called it safe, a safe haven or safe space for expressing thoughts. Additionally others talked about it being also a place where there was privacy and also confidential-ish. Quotes around inclusivity and openness: * Openness, curiosity, fun, belief that the internet can be a wonderful, creative place. * Safe spaces, where people feel comfortable to be their true authentic selves. Inclusivity, where everyone is welcomed, seen and heard. Encouragement and support in all aspects of life, from local classifieds-type of sharing, to deeper and more personal concerns. * having a safe community that supports each other 3.1.4 4) Curiosity/Intelligence Words people used to describe the value of curiosity include: insightful, interest, knowledge sharing, news sharing, resource sharing, resourcefulness, smart, thoughtful discussion, Curiosity, Interesting, learning, understanding, exploration. As we’ll see later, many folks said that the community was smart and that they appreciated the level of intelligence in discourse. Quotes around curiosity and intelligence: * Super bright people who are really nice and very tech savvy * Smart creative folks sharing and helping each other. * the confluence of curiosity, expertise and community * low-stakes learning community * Thoughtfully sharing highlights of the internet, commentary, empathy, joy, and advice * Interesting news, events, and discussions that I don’t find anywhere else 3.1.5 4) Kindness and Empathy The value of kindness and empathy took many forms: compassionate, helping, a caring community, connecting and nurturing, gentle, kind, wholesome-ness, earnest, empathy, integrity. Quotes that discuss kindness: * Supportive &amp; honest, and a kind place to be on the internet. * Empathy. A safe space to act like a social network without worrying about the bad parts of the internet. * Compassionate, empathetic, engaged community caring for each other’s creative pursuits to become more whole humans. * Creativity and empathy driven kindness Empathy and kindness centered willingness to be hyped up about almost anything * caring and helpful * Empathy and creativity.

Also, showing or trying for best practices for lots of things — inclusion, managing and sharing emotions appropriately (the #bad-attitude channel), the reactji people added 3.1.6 5) Emotional Intelligence and Integrity Folks seemed to convey a value in the community around emotional intelligence, though it wasn’t always named this. Some example phrases: acknowledgment of feelings, earnest good vibes, listening (before fixing). Getting consent, space for feeling feelings and witnessing others, meta communication, communication as a skill, keep the bad vibes in their own channels, Similar sentiments could be found in a sense of integrity in the community such as words like Thoughtful, Respect, Respectful, civility, honesty, humanity, principled, respectful, sincerity. Quotes: * Everyone is valuable and deserves to be treated with respect. * Acceptance of others and their ideas. Breadth and diversity of userbase. * Mutual support/big sense of community , interest in others ideas, joy of sharing and supporting, doing our best to make sure everyone is thoughtfully heard and included 3.1.7 Overall Values Statements Some folks shared phrases that seemed to be more general and to encompass several of the values above Collective hive-mind of support, creativity, appreciation for art with a set of overlapping societal principles that steer healthy moderation and a general openness to new dialogue or change. Be the internet you want to see in the world a commitment to the good parts of the web A like-minded community conscientious of etiquette, while encouraging curiosity and discovery without competing for popularity or ostracizing members. 3.1.8 Additional Quotes/Comments * I don&#39;t know that there are strong core values that come from the slack itself. I think it is in many ways a reflection of the event rather than it&#39;s own community with a sense of identity * To me, it was more than just a companion piece to the physical festival. I attended a few times, regretted not going the first year, and missed out on securing a spot in the last year. It was the crossroads of art, culture, and techology from a group of what felt like inclusionary, progressive and small &quot;l&quot; liberal people that agreed to operate under a code of conduct that emphasized politeness and kindness in a time when those things are not the norm (online or in public). * Progressivism, humanism, and a love for all things indie "],["appreciate-about-community.html", "Chapter 4 Appreciate About Community 4.1 Diversity of Perspectives 4.2 Kindness 4.3 Learning 4.4 Resources/Asking for Things 4.5 News 4.6 Cool Stuff People Share 4.7 Shared Values 4.8 Safety 4.9 Privacy 4.10 Community 4.11 Portland 4.12 Alternative to Media", " Chapter 4 Appreciate About Community The question we’ll discuss in this section was “What do you appreciate about the XOXO Slack community?” Unsurprisingly, this mirrored much of what was discussed in the values section, but with deeper explanation. ##The People By far, the overwhelming response to this question of what folks appreciate about the Slack is the other people in the Slack. I feel like I found my people here. The caliber of people and the fact that it’s about as safe of a space as I could imagine existing online. It might actually be the safest space online. I appreciate the opportunity to connect with all the wonderful people in the community. This group of intelligent, connected and, attentive people have enriched my existence in many ways, including just talking about important or interesting things in a relatively safe environment. so many incredible people, so willing to help each other The people, the various emoji that say a thousand words, the different channels for different topics, the thread-first approach to communicating, the organisation of everything thanks to folks like the moderators, and even the very active members I recognise! everyone is so awesome and kind the people, the thoughtful responses Local subject matter experts, friendly people, good discussion People who are like me, openly sharing who they are, sharing advice, support, empathy and making every experience shared and a little less hard The lovely humans that make up the community and how they interact with each other It’s an amazing place of creative people who are generous, kind, and a lot of fun. Also Andy Baio finds the best links. The ability to assume truthfulness or good faith in the things that are shared, and the ability to be possibly wrong, possibly clumsy, possibly human The way everyone embodies the value above and leads through their actions the people, the content, the kindness, the attitudes, and the opportunity for closer conversations with lovely people The XOXO Slack community is helping and giving. People care. People are enthusiasic about things! People are really smart and interesting! People’s willingness to be vulnerable and to hold space for others to be vulnerable All of those core values! And the sheer interestingness of the members of the community 4.1 Diversity of Perspectives One of the attributes of the people that folks commented on was how many diverse perspectives they felt could be found in the slack. The people who are on it, come from a lot of different perspectives and backgrounds and that makes it more interesting The variety of backgrounds and perspectives of participants Diversity of perspectives, freely given knowledge, empathy and compassion for experiences, range of interests, learning and growing together Such a breadth of experience and diverse skills in the members! That it’s far more of a diverse community – along almost any axis, other than perhaps political leanings – than I would ever have access to in my day to day life. diversity, empathy, endless curiosity 4.2 Kindness Many, many people in the survey described the community as kind. Some examples: I have a group of kind, caring humans who give a shit. Open minded people, kindness and empathy centered, a bastion of covid-awareness. I appreciate how people are supportive and share their thoughts Positivity, curiosity. People who are like me, openly sharing who they are, sharing advice, support, empathy and making every experience shared and a little less hard The kindness and enthusiasm Same thing! All the creative, kind people. The commitment to inclusivity and authenticity everyone is so awesome and kind The kindness, the knowledge, the generosity of spirit of everyone involved. everyone is so nice and we assume best intentions! also each account is one real person who has presumably interacted with the other people here IRL at least once, as part of a larger network (which lends some accountability/responsibility) People are nice to each other. There are regular characters. The usual Slack conveniences that make it possible for people to not repeat themselves and to let me ignore US politics if I want to. the small acts of kindness or indications of support people offer each other; emoji indications or threaded replies have genuinely lifted my spirits 4.3 Learning Folks also discussed how important it was to learn from others in the slack and how much they had learned over time. People talked about how smart other folks in the Slack are and how intelligent the conversations were in the channels. They also described the space as being curated and having a variety of things they wouldn’t otherwise see/hear about. I learn SO much. There’s so many smart voices. The smart creative, mostly likeminded folks. Local subject matter experts, friendly people, good discussion Honestly, the “closed” nature of the community worked for me for professional reasons. But I also loved the diversity of topics and how it let me get to know different people from the general community. Being able to ask all the dumb questions about anything and everything, and having really smart, capable people reply with their wisdom and resources From the delightful shared experience of the Animal Crossing channel in early Covid, to the freewheeling discussion of politics, to the creative problem solving and solidarity of many other channels, questions, learning and growth are supported and so are the personal connections we’ve forged at the festival and in this digital space. empathy, wisdom of the crowd, discovery Diversity of perspectives, freely given knowledge, empathy and compassion for experiences, range of interests, learning and growing together knowledge base Curious, smart, politically progressive In depth and well meaning discussions on difficult topics - seeing people’s various opinions and considerations help me form my own A large amount of very smart people all feeling like it’s a safe place to express their thoughts It’s a large group of smart, successful, creative, people who as a whole, is good-internet. I’ve made friends and professional connections here and my favorite by-product is the community’s ability to help me gather information on almost anything, which also spoils me because I’m not confident in my abilities to find reliable information through traditional web searches. 4.4 Resources/Asking for Things Respondents discussed using the Slack to share knowledge, ask for help and to learn from one another. They described people being generous and helpful when they did so. I love having a place to keep up to date with links and stories shared in channels plus a place to connect and ask questions on a variety of topics. When I have a question about damn near anything (resource, fact, local stuff, whatever) someone knows the answer and is likely to be similar enough in mindset to me that I can trust it. And, the goofy shit I like to share always seems to find an appreciative crowd Breadth of channels. I can ask/answer Maker or home-improvement questions, keep up to date on tech/politics, and see folks being happy about stuff they made or found. People’s openness to help, share knowledge, and generally be excepting When I have a question about damn near anything (resource, fact, local stuff, whatever) someone knows the answer and is likely to be similar enough in mindset to me that I can trust it. And, the goofy shit I like to share always seems to find an appreciative crowd Being able to ask all the dumb questions about anything and everything, and having really smart, capable people reply with their wisdom and resources Ability to ask kind individuals both hard and easy questions across a variety of topics People who are like me, openly sharing who they are, sharing advice, support, empathy and making every experience shared and a little less hard Diversity of perspectives, freely given knowledge, empathy and compassion for experiences, range of interests, learning and growing together Feedback and support Quality information I appreciate the broad range of skills and expertise. I also love that we all are passionate about something and we’re open to hearing about other’s passions. the ability to drop in and engage, the willingness of the community to provide support (responses, engagement, advice, etc.) and the depth and breadth of knowledge across all its members I like that I have a place to hear about the things I’d hear about on social media (news, tech news, neat creative projects, dumb jokes) without the context collapse of social media, and in a moderated and kind environment. As a curated microcosm of the internet at large, I can dip my toe in and feel rewarded without getting hit with the anxiety and overwhelm - and the smaller scale means I’ve made some lasting friendships and connections because I’m able to show up more fully than I would if I was more afraid. private identity channels; knowing that i can ask basic questions and people love info-dumping with no judgement It’s a large group of smart, successful, creative, people who as a whole, is good-internet. I’ve made friends and professional connections here and my favorite by-product is the community’s ability to help me gather information on almost anything, which also spoils me because I’m not confident in my abilities to find reliable information through traditional web searches. SO much. It’s a place where I learn about and discuss current events and art with folks I like and admire. Also, frankly, it’a a place I can lurk! I expreience severe rejection sensitivity in online spaces, so the fact that I can pop a little emoji next to a post to show sympathy, curiosity, etc is really nice for me. I also experience the moderation as very present, compassionate, and firm, which REALLY makes a difference in the space. 4.5 News Folks also described the slack as the place that they used to find the news, and that they relied on each other to have compelling and interesting conversations about topics that were on the front page of the newspapers. a way to get news, to get fresh and useful perspectives on news (politics and tech, mostly) Great source for news &amp; interesting projects from all around the internet, fantastic discussions with smart people who are experts on various topics Resources in news/likeminded spirit Discussions on the XOXO Slack are always my first choice for any online interaction, it’s replaced all news sites Excellent moderation, ability to check in for local Portland events plus national events (like politics and C19). My first go-to community for EVERYTHING, including classifieds. Very up to date news, an active community, lots of channels dedicated to very specific topics It’s a place where I can stay abreast on the difficult topics of the modern digital world and remain connected to other digital artists without the terrible emotional pain that comes along with using social media like Twitter Surfaces good posts and news (replaced social media). People there make me feel seen. We don’t ramble, we share and support. I don’t like to consume news because of its ill effect on my mental health, and this Slack helps me stay engaged with issues I care about. I appreciate hearing the perspectives of this community. 4.6 Cool Stuff People Share People described the benefit of being in a space where folks share cool stuff and they get to have curated content that they like. Being able to stay in touch with friends made at XOXO. Seeing and hearing about all the cool stuff people make and share, whether from within the community or elsewhere. Recommendations on local and online businesses for specific needs. Great source for news &amp; interesting projects from all around the internet, fantastic discussions with smart people who are experts on various topics Curated content, exclusive access, there are experts in everything Fellow nerds and weirdos who read the internet so I don’t have to. Also I like that sharing is encouraged. I’m not someone with any real online presence so it’s nice having that space. Also, being able to have people productively disagree, though there have been a few instance of that being tested in the politics channel, the way it was handled by the Andy’s was I think very good. empathy, wisdom of the crowd, discovery 4.7 Shared Values Many folks talked about how they shared values with others in the community, including the upholding of the code of conduct, the sense of political alignment and a common belief in the idea that folks should be acting in ways that are not harmful. it’s a community with a shared ethos rather than shared subject matter, large enough to have lots of casual relationships/interactions but not the entire goddamn internet It’s the only social network that feels truly connected and wholesome. I use it to connect with a community of people that share my values, and know that the people sharing information care about the quality of their information, and will always act in the best interest of the community and each other. And if anybody acts in harmful ways, they will learn from their mistakes and act differently (or be removed from the community) General political/social alignment, joyfulness, creativity, persistence of identity A group with diverse backgrounds and experiences but shared values Varied perspectives, but somehow lots of people with the same morals as you. Easy to make friends. People who are like me, openly sharing who they are, sharing advice, support, empathy and making every experience shared and a little less hard it’s a collection of nice people who do interesting things, the whole community is invested in upholding the existing CoC/culture, the word “building” comes to mind (community/each other up/cool stuff/process/etc.) Nearly everyone visible on Slack* appears committed to the core values of the Slack, providing a safe space for others, enforcing norms to that end, and politely accepting correction from others. There is a general understanding that not all behavior or speech can be welcome and still offer the safety needed to help people be and grow true to themselves. (*Behavior outside of this range may be happening and is not visible due to vigilant moderator efforts.) It’s the only social network that feels truly connected and wholesome. I use it to connect with a community of people that share my values, and know that the people sharing information care about the quality of their information, and will always act in the best interest of the community and each other. And if anybody acts in harmful ways, they will learn from their mistakes and act differently (or be removed from the community) Learning from the breadth of knowledge and experience of my Slack pals in a place where we tacitly acknowledging shared beliefs that I can’t assume are shared everywhere (caring for other people, respecting other people’s experiences and privacy) 4.8 Safety One of those shared values seemed to be safety. People consistently referred to the slack as a safe space, or a place were they felt they could be themselves. They also commented that this made the space trustworthy and easy to be in. * people assume good intent and read with compassion and reply with civility; it’s a safe space for people with marginalized identities, people are funny and kind and creative and there’s very little ‘rock star’ attitude (even from people who are literally rock stars) * The safety and established trust. * The caliber of people and the fact that it’s about as safe of a space as I could imagine existing online. It might actually be the safest space online. * It seems like both a safe place for optimism and constructive criticism. * A safe place for me to land for professional and personal needs * I love having a place full of people I respect and admire, where I nonetheless feel safe being honest and vulnerable. * It is consistently the kindest space I’m a part of. It’s also the largest space I’m a part of that feels private and provides safety in its privacy. * Such a thoughtful space! I do not know how much moderation it requires, but from the outside it is a smoothly functioning space full of independent-minded folks, which is no small thing! I feel safe and cared about, even by relative strangers. People also described this as a place with people they could trust My views align with those around me, and I enjoy chatting with people who share common ground. Since we all respect the code of conduct, there’s less negative behavior, making interactions smoother. I value learning from the random, niche interests everyone brings, as someone always has expertise in something I’m curious about. These diverse perspectives help me expand my understanding and knowledge. The broad spectrum of experiences and knowledge so that I can find out about a lot of different topics, from people who I feel like I can trust because they’ve been vetted. 4.9 Privacy Some folks linked safety with the privacy of the space. It is consistently the kindest space I’m a part of. It’s also the largest space I’m a part of that feels private and provides safety in its privacy. Honestly, the “closed” nature of the community worked for me for professional reasons. But I also loved the diversity of topics and how it let me get to know different people from the general community. The wide world will never see it so I can really be myself 4.10 Community People discussed community as something that they felt a part of, that was important to them and that they shared with others. It’s a very welcoming community, there’s a shared sense of how hard it is to make things and an appreciation of what people do It gives me a hometown, which I haven’t had in ages and ages I like how people don’t jump to knives at the first opportunity, and appreciated that an Andy would step in and lay down the kindness law, gently then firmly, if needed, while not putting down one side or the other. I also like how people are able to browse and find others who have similar interests by looking at the channel list. I like that there are private spaces, as well. I also appreciate the ‘benevolent dictators’ both the structure but also that our dictators are kind, patient, and passionate. The ease of re-engaging after varying levels of activity, but also a core group of active members. This is the only only community I’ve belonged to where I feel most comfortable expressing opinions and not competing for popularity. In other social networks, I’m often forced to create separate identities for friends/family, private, and professional audiences. the ability to drop in and engage, the willingness of the community to provide support (responses, engagement, advice, etc.) and the depth and breadth of knowledge across all its members it’s a collection of nice people who do interesting things, the whole community is invested in upholding the existing CoC/culture, the word “building” comes to mind (community/each other up/cool stuff/process/etc.) it sits perfectly at the intersection of art, technology, nerdery, and social good. there are plenty of communities that bridge two of those things but I haven’t found another that covers off on all of them like XOXO does. The ability to communicate with others across multiple points of interest and the opportunities for mutual aid through ideas, concepts, and real world help. Connection. This community has gotten me through some really hard times and while I may not know many of the folks here in person, I consider many of them friends. #portland and #classifieds for local connection, #good-internet / #politics-and-news / #tech-culture to keep up with relevant news and events Ability to vent and then find distractions and cool things and inspiration So many things. It’s a place to go with wild ideas, or burning questions, or amusing anecdotes. It is a place to be supported and to give support. #Openness People also described the community as open: People’s openness to help, share knowledge, and generally be excepting Open minded people, kindness and empathy centered, a bastion of covid-awareness. Openness, creativity, sharing and support that it’s open, helpful, welcoming, entertaining 4.11 Portland Folks in Portland in particular talked about how useful the slack was to find things in their community. I’m a lurker, more than a poster. The #portland slack has been incredibly valuable as a local. I’ve attended events, visited restaurants, learned about civic activities, and donated to causes I learned about via Slack. For Portland especially, xoxo is a wonderful resource of news, vendors, events. Its relative privacy and safety, most of the cool new things I’ve learned about in Portland and on the Internet were via this Slack. It’s been a really good resource for things going on in Portland Oregon! Otherwise it’s just nice to see what people are up to or reading. feels like the small room of good internet circa 2010-2015 and/or like Twitter before it got bad. Secondly, as a new native to Portland I really appreciate participating in a community of like-minded local creators 4.12 Alternative to Media Some folks talked about the community as a place where they could have a discussion that wasn’t as broken as some of the media we have now. It’s a group that cares about and wants the best from the Internet, but without the blind techno-Utopianism of mainstream tech culture. I like that I have a place to hear about the things I’d hear about on social media (news, tech news, neat creative projects, dumb jokes) without the context collapse of social media, and in a moderated and kind environment. As a curated microcosm of the internet at large, I can dip my toe in and feel rewarded without getting hit with the anxiety and overwhelm - and the smaller scale means I’ve made some lasting friendships and connections because I’m able to show up more fully than I would if I was more afraid. It’s a place where I can stay abreast on the difficult topics of the modern digital world and remain connected to other digital artists without the terrible emotional pain that comes along with using social media like Twitter A digital shelter from a capitalistic web It helps keep me centered in a greedy, competitive world. nice place for nerds to nerd out "],["concerns.html", "Chapter 5 Concerns 5.1 Losing the Community 5.2 Fragmentation 5.3 Loss of Contacts/Connections/Networks 5.4 Loss of Resources 5.5 Loss of Special XOXO Spirit 5.6 I’ll Never Find Something Like This Again 5.7 This Slack is Different 5.8 Slack as a “Third Space”” 5.9 Mental Health and Well Being 5.10 Concerns about New Platforms 5.11 New Leadership 5.12 People who Lurk 5.13 Newcomers 5.14 Positive Words 5.15 Concerns About Safety 5.16 I’ll Go Wherever 5.17 Concerns about Channels 5.18 Missing the Emojis", " Chapter 5 Concerns We asked folks “What concerns (if any) do you have as the XOXO Slack winds down?” 5.1 Losing the Community People were very concerned about losing the community that was built. * Significant loss of community and support * I am concerned that I will lose track of folks and the important, silly and entertaining chats we have * Losing touch with the community * We will lose people. * It will be hard to find “my people” again in other places * The lack of community that has a baseline of trust good enough to bring its users forwards. I won’t have people to bounce ideas off of who I know share my values, I won’t be able to look for jobs with people that share my moral code. It’s tough. * The community won’t continue, I’ll no longer be in a vibrant internet community * Losing connection and community — I’m kind of terrified of what my world will look like without this space (but I definitely understand and respect the decision). * massive dropoff in participation/access, potentially less user-friendly new platform, increase in anonymity, potential decrease in community trust/network * I stumbled upon the after-slack channel kinda randomly and had no idea it existed or that the slack would be winding down, and I’m kinda surprised there hasn’t been a post in #announcements about it to get more people aware and involved. * That I won’t be able to engage with a community I’ve come to appreciate and speak/discuss things in a friendly and safe space. 5.2 Fragmentation Folks mentioned worrying about the splintering, fracturing or fragmenting of the community. Fragmentation of the community. Or a replacement that doesn’t allow for the same breadth of topics and discussions. Discord sucks at threading, and threaded topics keep a lot of the xoxo slack legible and approachable. I just don’t want to lose these people, or the quality of the discourse we have. I worry that this community will fracture in a way that will eventually fizzle out. We all care where this goes, but that doesn’t necessarily make it easy. The community splintering a bit (inevitable) as some point just won’t migrate to certain platforms probably Splintering of the groups into isolated subgroups that are harder to find. I really think that we’ll never be as central as we are now; we’re going to scatter and lose track of each other The community fragmenting into many different new spaces and it being difficult to know where everyone went I think the community will scatter, so it’s not really a concern, but it’s something I’m sad about. I’m worried the community will fragment and it won’t be as diverse and full of a wide variety of experiences and viewpoints. Fragmenting the community, not replicating the x-channel experience elsewhere, fear of choosing an under-supported chat/forum solution and running into maintainence difficulties and seeing the community die out Fears: 1. the community scatters to the wind without a clear locus 2. community gets fragmented 3. no other such community exists /cannot be replaced 4. do not want to lose this both local &amp; extended community Similar to the worries about fragmentation were folks worried about the lack of coherence in a new setting. I feel concerned that a group won’t cohere in a new place, and that values and conduct will be harder to manage without the same leadership. Maintaining connections with people from this group without having to join a lot of small things in different places I don’t want to lose the community we created 5.3 Loss of Contacts/Connections/Networks People also worried about the loss of the people they know, and the contacts and network that the community is made of: that we’ll all scatter to the winds losing touch with locals and those I rarely see I really rely on hearing from my friends in my little pane of glass every day, I don’t know what I will do w/o them Losing regular contact with the community who shared those core values I really appreciate this tiny corner of the internet and all the voices; will be sad if it goes away completely! disintegrating connections/strong as well as distant relationships, lost art and humour and logs of supportiveness, loss of casual but trusted and confident advice and recommendations Just that I’ll miss every one. I’ll miss people (en masse), though I don’t know anyone well enough to actively keep in touch more work to connect with people outside the Slack losing touch with people I’ve met, losing the breadth/diversity of content and opinions. I love how many amazing things I have discovered beit art or technology projects or information about local activities that I wouldn’t have known about if not for this community. Losing that incredible social network both in terms of resources but also in just enriching my daily life Speaking entirely selfishly, I’m worried that I will lose contact with a network of artistically successful, like-minded, and supportive people. I’m not a member of other communities so capable of helping me do better work or promote that work, and otherwise connecting me with opportunities that interest me (employment or otherwise). XOXO Slack is both private and populated with people I admire in various fields, as well as friends I don’t otherwise have contact with. I have IRL friends and other online communities, but no group as diverse or as interesting as XOXO. I can’t imagine building such a network from scratch today, especially with the degradation of online social networking tools. Losing this community of amazing people. i’ll miss being able to connect with this group of people, and seeing the fascinating things they share and make We’ll loose a lot of people and breadth of experience Not having a place to vent, losing contact with people I care about, not having a place to process emotions and seek advice and talk about things like ptsd, anxiety, depression, impostor syndrome and also feeling alone when I don’t see others going through the same things Losing touch with some of my favorite people on in the internet (only a few of whom I’ve met IRL) Missing out on turning those weak connections with peers in channels into far greater friendships. I’m concerned about losing touch with people, and about losing an active stream of content/conversation Losing track of everyone and all of the great resources and conversations. Losing the job board. 5.4 Loss of Resources Folks talked about the resource of the community and their fears about losing those resources. I’m worried I might lose some of those resources and community at a time when online spaces already seem to be shrinking. Losing a source of important things happening in the world, losing a source of positive information. I fear that I will lose access to an important source of information and I’ll end up having to stay up to date in stressful spaces losing the incredible resources of this community Keeping all that varied input together Losing all of the incredible resources/recommendations that I’ve saved there as well as all the people I’ve connected with who I’m maybe not connected with on other areas of the internet The splintering of the community and loss of archive. The strength of the community comes from the interactions between folks. I explore the slack daily and learn so much and interact as much as my stamina can handle. Sometimes often, sometimes not. but! The variety of opinions and conversations is so important and ensuring there’s minimal friction for folks to engage is important. I also search the archives for help and having a persistent record is useful to me. disintegrating connections/strong as well as distant relationships, lost art and humour and logs of supportiveness, loss of casual but trusted and confident advice and recommendations Loss of creative ballast and diminished trust in humanity. Not being able to connect to people whose opinions, feedback, and camaraderie I’ve grow to trust and rely on 5.5 Loss of Special XOXO Spirit There was also a sense of loss of the intangible sense of the spirit of this community Initially, the new space doesn’t sufficiently capture the spirit. Long-term, that it degrades. While it’s probably inevitable that a platform shift will cause some people to drift away/not come with, I am hoping there is something that reflects the same core values of the Slack community in a sustainable (financially, emotional labor-wise) way This Slack also had a subtly reinforced etiquette amongst active users, like threading topics, redirecting to niche channels, or contextualizing shared links. I fear a new platform will drive a wedge between active core users, seasonal festival users, and new non-XOXO members. Each channel also differs in etiquette and moderation, which can be lost in translation when migrated. Losing people, losing the intangible thing that exists on the XOXO Slack Keeping the same community and thoughtfulness together on whatever new platform that the magic will dim; this is reliably my favorite place online Losing people, losing the intangible thing that exists on the XOXO Slack Scared we won’t catch this vibe again, and will end up with a rump-xoxo slack that is somehow sad Losing instances of kismet or good luck which occur when a very large group of talented people are all drawn to the same place - there’s a kind of magic to being surrounded by people who are also devoted to both kindness and trying their best at what they do. There are not many places in the world where I could say as an artist, “Randomly, I’m obsessed with these repeat-pattern window films” and someone says “Oh, my wife is half of that design team!” and now we’re in touch and might get to make cool stuff 5.6 I’ll Never Find Something Like This Again I will never find such valuable community I’ll miss it and it won’t be replaced with something else. I really don’t know anywhere else like this :( I don’t know where I’m going to find another similar community, or to find these people elsewhere! I’m just worried I won’t be able to find the next spot! 5.7 This Slack is Different There was a sense that this place is different than other types of social media and so it cannot be easily replaced with another platform or group of people. I’m going to lose all the friends I haven’t made yet! And I don’t want to be on public social media. The cross discipline nature of the whole group adds so many perspectives and variety to conversations. More topic-focused successors might lose that. losing insights on tech that aren’t awful and are instead optimistic, losing local (Portland) knowledge base Loosing instant access to a wonderful community of people that has filled the social media hole in my life after deleting everything but LinkedIn. I am just so sick of everybody-has-a-megaphone performative-outrage social meida sites. 5.8 Slack as a “Third Space”” Other folks talked about the slack as a sort of “third place” or a spot that one returns to. Some folks talked about it as a water cooler or a place to hang out. I really rely on hearing from my friends in my little pane of glass every day, I don’t know what I will do w/o them Lose touch with people, lose my “third place” where I have felt the most comfortable online. I work from home and it’s my main watercooler! Will miss that and hope the replacement functions similarly. It’s my favorite place on the internet 5.9 Mental Health and Well Being Some folks talked about the slack being a place that combatted their loneliness, their doomscrolling and that it contributed to their well being. They were concerned that their lives would be worse without the slack. To lose the great connections, inspiration, advice and live a lonelier life loss of community, disconnection, isolation Losing a community that is a vital pillar of my mental heath with no idea how to replace it if we don’t figure out a way to keep it going. Not having a place to vent, losing contact with people I care about, not having a place to process emotions and seek advice and talk about things like ptsd, anxiety, depression, impostor syndrome and also feeling alone when I don’t see others going through the same things I doomscroll again I’m very concerned about losing this space as the internet becomes more hostile. I feel very socially isolated right now and this going away is going to make that worse The XOXO Slack has been a valuable resource for me, both as a news source (as someone who doesn’t spend any time on public social media) and as a community. It has been especially valuable during the pandemic. I would really miss having that connection to a group of similarly pandemic-cautious people to remind me that it’s the rest of the world that’s making wild choices, not us. 5.10 Concerns about New Platforms Some folks shared their concerns about new platforms Future loss or disassociation from the historical community record, challenges with invitation/openness to new users on a new platform i’m not going to use discord and that seems like it will be where yall go Keeping the same community and thoughtfulness together on whatever new platform It was my favourite Slack for sure, but I don’t think it necessarily has anything to do with the technology. It could have been a web board or a Reddit or whatever made the moderation and the delicate balance of inclusion and exclusion work. I would be excited to join another or multiple communities that spawn from here based on their mandates. Being able to talk about culture and technology and art are important to me and the lack of geographical boundaries benefitted me living outside of a major US city. Which platform we end up on. Will a free tier slack work for us? Will discord’s gamer stink scare people away? Will a third option for our needs? It’s hard to know! Having to learn to navigate a new non-slack on line community. I like Discord. That the community has an easy transition to a new space, without unnecessary technical barriers, and that whatever comes next (at least initially) remains as a closed community. I really dislike Discord and am worried we’ll either get fractured into so. many spaces we’ll lose the magic that exists on Slack or that we’ll move to something I’m not comfortable with and don’t want to be on. * I worry we will end up on some corporate platform and be in the exact same situation in a few years I want us to find a new home that can stay as dynamic and vibrant. That can be appreciated in both real time and periodically. 5.11 New Leadership Some voiced concerns about whomever assumes the leadership of what comes next. This grew organically and thoughtfully as an outgrowth of the conference. I worry about platform, lack of Andy’s-ness. I’m a little worried about new leaders making decisions that drive folks away, but I’m much more worried about nobody taking the reins and everyone slowly fragmenting and dispersing. Super tough for whoever decides to take on volunteer responsibility We’ve been able to operate a digital space under implicit values and norms established by the IRL event. Without the Andys as our benevolent dictators (even if in actuality much/most Slack moderation wasn’t done by them), and potentially without the context of IRL XOXO if we eventually let in outsiders, recreating the same psychological safety will require more work. I’m also concerned about community attrition; an “unofficial” thing without an annual event may be more difficult to maintain healthy numbers (which ties into potentially bringing in new members) Some discussed concerns around governing with a new leadership how do we govern the new space? how to avoid a single mercurial owner-member shutting it down abruptly? can we pay folks to moderate/manage the community? or is it something like a nonprofit board? this community is worth paying for. Governance, if building trust in the new decision makers What comes next? How should it be similar and different? Will I be allowed into the next thing? If something new spins up, how could I contribute to it’s sustainability and success? Retention and activity with inevitably drop, members may place unrealistic or high demands to match the current level of moderation on the new team I think charismatic leadership/tone setting and moderation should be separate functions, as they require two different strengths; one requires openness and vision, while the second requires more rigidity and control. how do we make decisions as a group? The xoxo community belongs to the community. How can these decisions be make without the community 5.12 People who Lurk Folks specifically brought up the topic of folks who “lurk” in the slack and don’t post much. I imagine there are a lot of lurkers who still get a lot of value. Personally I actually add to a conversation like once a month maybe? And I’m worried that any sort of “oops it all fragmented into a million communities” will maybe impact those folks the most. Though maybe part of community is participating, so idk. the xoxo community (and slack) is made up of all of the people, lurkers as well as active posters. I worry that the new community will only have currently active people who will try to attain a kind of nostalgia instead of allowing it to move forward in a way that preserves our shared ideas of community 5.13 Newcomers Some respondents highlighted the difference in responses for those who are newer to the community: being new in 2024 means less of a ‘loss’ for me personally, in terms of a history with the slack, but that belies a concern that longer or more tightly-knit cohorts that have existed throughout will splinter off and those newer folks may not have that or as easy an ability to catalyze a transition as those older folks with more historical relationships in the community, so an understanding of that and some way of making sure there isn’t so much slipping through the cracks if there doesn’t have to be The thing is that I want this to be an opportunity for growth, including opening up invitations eventually. I know not everyone will make the jump, and even less will be frequent users, but I really hope this is also an opportunity to bring in new voices. I was a volunteer this year, and some thing that Andy said was to be mindful of the fact that for many people this was their first XOXO, so don’t make it all about sipping on the sweet nectar of your memories. I want the next chapter to be like that, but more. sorry for the long answer 5.14 Positive Words Some folks shared words of affirmation or enthusiasm for what comes next instead of concerns I am confident that the community wants to continue. This is a curated group and allowing new people in will change that in fundamental ways. I think it’s okay if the community “winds down” (fewer users) because there’s still a core happening, and people can come back in as their own needs change. I’d be sad to see the community drift apart; so glad there’s an effort to create a new one! In truth, it will evolve, but never be the same. It’s like an unconference, the experience just happens there and just for the people there. It will live on, just in a different way I suspect that I will not be as comfortable, sharing more personal things in any other forum. And that’s OK. This is giving me an opportunity to reach out to the people they would like to stay in touch with. While it’s probably inevitable that a platform shift will cause some people to drift away/not come with, I am hoping there is something that reflects the same core values of the Slack community in a sustainable (financially, emotional labor-wise) way Some discussed their sadness around the shift No concerns really, it’s just sad 5.15 Concerns About Safety Privacy and safety. What prevents people from screenshotting and sharing once channels go inactive? What rules will there be for this new era of interaction with the archives? 5.16 I’ll Go Wherever Some said they would go to whatever comes next: Would like to follow the diaspora to other venues I don’t really care where it goes, as long as it survives. 5.17 Concerns about Channels Keeping various sub-communities (channels) and safety of the space 5.18 Missing the Emojis I’ll miss the custom emojis; they were a second language to this community. i will feel like i have lost a ton of my working vocabulary if we lose all our reactji! and I will very much miss people who for whatever reason can’t transition to whatever comes next "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
