## What This Is 

This is a vibe check community survey of the [XOXO Fest Slack community](https://xoxofest.com/). In early October 2024, Andy McMillan and Andy Baio (sometimes collectively referred to as “the Andys”) who are the organizers of the festival and the Slack announced that because the festival ended, they would be closing down the XOXO Slack community that has been a mainstay of the community since the beginning of the festival. 

There was a lot of discussion in the Slack about what would come next. Some folks suggested we might want to do a survey to discuss next directions, specifically which platforms folks wanted, what their concerns were and what the positive directions this shift might take. We also wanted to give folks a chance to share their feelings and emotions about the shift and to share their gratitude. 


Beth Duckles put together this survey to solicit community feedback. We put it out on October 9th, 2024 and gave the community about a week to respond. We received 154 responses to the survey. Analysis was done by Beth Duckles and Rosa Quiñones, the report was written by Beth Duckles with editing and feedback from Benjamin Chait, Stacy-Marie Ishmael, Matt Lee, Josh Millard, Nora Ryan, Pete Modica-Soloway and David Werthheimer.  



## How We Did It

This report is meant to summarize the findings and to pull out key themes so as to start the conversation. Beth and Rosa did a quick organization of the comments for each question into themes as a way to share the information that came from the survey. In each theme, we add a lot of quotes in bullets that describe what we saw. 

The qualitative coding/tagging (meaning grouping responses into themes) is rough, imperfect and it was done very quickly. We wanted the community have something fast more than we wanted to make it perfect. Because this was done quickly, there may be themes in the data we didn't highlight, names for themes that seem off, or quotes that are miscatagorized. 

The goal was to create an easier way to start a community discussion, not a final "in stone" explanation of what everyone was saying. By reflecting what we saw/read in the data, we're hoping to give more data to the conversation. 


## The Data 

There is a lot here, so we understand that it might feel overwhelming. We feel strongly that listening to the many voices of other people involves letting their words be at the center. So there are a lot (a lot) of quotes. You will certainly see the same quote in multiple places which can feel repetitive.  

Typos are likely, you're welcome to copy edit what the researchers have written. 

However, in this kind of research, we don’t edit what people write in their response to the survey. This means that if there are typos in what people wrote in their survey responses, those are reflected without editing here. 

## Gift 

This research is a gift freely to a community that has given us so so much. 

I (Beth), do research like this for communities as a research consultant and would be happy to talk to you about doing research for communities you're a part of. I was able to do this work because of some freedom in my schedule, but am always looking for new clients. If you want to talk to me about research projects for hire or want to drop a few bucks my way, find me on the slack at bduckles or beth@duckles.com or online at [Beth Duckles](https://bethduckles.com/).
